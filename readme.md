# TinyCardsConverter

Convert Tiny Cards exported file (csv) to json that is easier to use for example with javascript in a web application. 

The Tiny cards service will end at September 1, 2020. I made this convertion tool to export the data so that I could use them in an app that I have created that works in a similar way to the Tiny cards app. Having 30+ decks and 2000+ cards that I did not want to loose.
